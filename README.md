# Optimization of Hybrid Solar-Wind Energy System for Hospital in London

This repository contains a MATLAB-based optimization project focused on designing a hybrid energy system for a hospital. The system integrates solar photovoltaics (PV), wind turbines, and battery storage, aimed at reducing energy costs and minimizing dependency on the grid while ensuring reliable energy supply for critical medical operations.

## Introduction

Hospitals are among the most energy-intensive facilities, requiring continuous and reliable power sources to support medical operations. This project develops an energy optimization model to design a hybrid solar-wind energy system for a hospital located in London, UK. By incorporating solar PV, wind turbines, and battery storage, the goal is to provide a self-sufficient energy system that minimizes grid dependency, reduces operational costs, and supports sustainability goals.

The hybrid system is optimized to meet the hospital's energy demands while maximizing the utilization of renewable energy resources, considering the hospital's daily load profile, environmental conditions, and space constraints.

## Project Description

This project involves the design and optimization of a hybrid energy system that includes solar PV, wind turbines, and battery storage. The system is optimized using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to determine the optimal configuration of PV panels, wind turbines, and battery cells that minimize investment costs while fulfilling the following constraints:

- **SOC Constraints:** The state of charge (SOC) of the battery must remain within 50% to 90%.
- **Power Supply Constraints:** The system must meet the energy load requirements, with any excess energy being exported.
- **Space Constraints:** The total space required for the PV panels and wind turbines must not exceed the usable area of the hospital’s rooftop or nearby land.

The optimization procedure also integrates a financial analysis to evaluate the feasibility and payback period of the system based on energy savings and export revenues via the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG) scheme.

## Data Sources and Files

### Data Sources
- **Hospital Load Data:** The hospital's energy consumption profile (including load data from HVAC systems, lighting, medical equipment, etc.) was obtained from The Building Data Genome Project 2.
- **Solar Irradiance and Temperature Data:** Hourly solar irradiance and temperature data for the year 2016 were obtained from the PVGIS database.
- **Wind Speed Data:** Hourly wind speed data was sourced from the Global Wind Atlas, considering the hospital’s location and average wind speeds in London.

### Data Files
- **dailydata12monthsaverage.csv:** Solar irradiance and temperature data for 12 months.
- **wind_speed.txt:** Hourly wind speed data for the hospital’s location.
- **load3.txt:** The hospital’s electricity load data.
- **Adjusted_12x24_Data_Table.csv:** Processed and cleaned data, formatted for ease of use.
- **Optimization of Energy Systems Report.pdf:** Detailed report and economic analysis of the project.

## Optimization Methodology

The optimization model is implemented in MATLAB and follows these steps:
1. **Input Data:** Load the hospital's energy load profile, solar irradiance, wind speed, and temperature data.
2. **System Sizing:** Calculate the power generated by each component (PV, wind, and battery).
3. **Genetic Algorithm:**
   - Optimize the number of PV panels, wind turbines, and battery cells.
   - Minimize the total system investment cost, including both capital and operational expenses.
   - Constraints include meeting energy load requirements, staying within battery SOC limits, and respecting available land area for installation.
4. **Results:** The model outputs the best configuration of the system, along with financial metrics like payback period and internal rate of return (IRR).
