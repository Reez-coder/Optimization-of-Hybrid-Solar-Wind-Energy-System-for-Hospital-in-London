## Introduction

This MATLAB-based optimization project designs a **hybrid energy system** for  a hospital located in London, UK, using **solar PV**, **wind turbines**, and **battery storage**. The goal is to minimize **energy costs** and **grid dependency** while ensuring a **reliable power supply** for medical operations.

## Project Description

This system is optimized using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to determine the optimal configuration that minimizes the total system investment cost over a 10-year lifetime, while fulfilling the following constraints:

- **SOC Constraints:** The state of charge (SOC) of the battery must remain within 50% to 90%.
- **Power Supply Constraints:** The system must meet the energy load requirements, with excess energy being exported.
- **Space Constraints:** The total space required for the PV panels and wind turbines must not exceed the usable area of the hospitalâ€™s rooftop or nearby land.

The optimization procedure also integrates a financial analysis to evaluate the feasibility and payback period of the system based on energy savings and export revenues via the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG) scheme.

## Optimization Methodology

###   Model Inputs

**Time Resolution:**

$$
\Delta T = 0.5 \text{ hr} \quad \text{(12 days Ã— 24 hr = 288 hours)}
$$

**Scaled Load Profile:**

$$
P_{\text{load}}(t) = P_{\text{load,raw}}(t) \cdot (1 + g)^{y}, \quad g = 0.025, \quad y = 10
$$

###  System Equations

####  PV Output

$$
P_{\text{PV}}(t) = N_{\text{pv}} \cdot \eta_{\text{PV}} \cdot \frac{P_{\text{STC}}}{G_{\text{STC}}} \cdot \left(1 + C_T(T(t) - T_{\text{STC}})\right) \cdot G(t) \cdot (1 - r_{\text{deg}})^{y-1}
$$

####   Wind Turbine Output

$$
P_{\text{wind}}(t) = N_{\text{turb}} \cdot \left( A + B \cdot v(t) + C \cdot v(t)^2 \right) \cdot P_{\text{turb}}
$$

Where \( A, B, C \) are constants computed from cut-in $$\(v_{ci} = 2.5\)$$ and rated speed $$\(v_r = 10\)$$.

####  Battery State of Charge (SOC)

$$
SOC(t+1) = SOC(t) + \frac{\eta_{\text{bat}} \cdot P_{\text{bat}}(t) \cdot \Delta T}{N_{\text{cell}} \cdot C_{\text{cell}}}
$$

#### Power Output 

$$
P_{\text{total}} = \eta_{\text{DCDC}} \cdot P_{\text{PV}}(t) + \eta_{\text{ACDCw}} \cdot P_{\text{wind}}(t)
$$

## Objective Function

Minimize total cost over 10 years:

$$
C(X) = min (N_{\text{pv}} (C_{\text{inv,panel}} + OPEX_{\text{PV}}) + N_{\text{cell}} (C_{\text{inv,cell}} + OPEX_{\text{Battery}}) + N_{\text{turb}} (C_{\text{inv,turb}} + OPEX_{\text{Wind}}))
$$


## Constraints
### **Lower and Upper Bounds**


$$
X_l = [1, \, N_{\text{cell,min}}, \, N_{\text{turb,min}}, \, SOC_{\text{ini,min}}]
$$

$$
X_u = [N_{\text{pv,max}}, \, N_{\text{cell,max}}, \, N_{\text{turb,max}}, \, SOC_{\text{ini,max}}]
$$

  
### Inequality Constraints

$$
\begin{aligned}
& SOC_{\text{min}} \leq SOC(t) \leq SOC_{\text{max}} \\
& \max(P_{\text{unsup}}(t)) = 0 \\
& SOC(0) = SOC(T_{\text{end}}) \\
& N_{\text{pv}} \cdot A_{\text{pv}} + N_{\text{turb}} \cdot A_{\text{turb}} \leq A_{\text{usable}}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Variable Bounds

$$
\begin{aligned}
1 &\leq N_{\text{pv}} \leq \left\lfloor \frac{A_{\text{usable}}}{A_{\text{pv}}} \right\rfloor \\
10 &\leq N_{\text{cell}} \leq 1000 \\
0 &\leq N_{\text{turb}} \leq \left\lfloor \frac{A_{\text{usable}}}{A_{\text{turb}}} \right\rfloor \\
SOC_{\text{min}} &\leq SOC_{\text{init}} \leq SOC_{\text{max}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Optimization Method

MATLABâ€™s **Genetic Algorithm** is used to solve:

$$
\min_{X \in \mathbb{R}^4} \quad C(X) \quad \text{subject to constraints}
$$

**GA Settings:**

- Population Size: 500  
- Max Generations: 10,000  
- Function Tolerance: $$\(10^{-12}\)$$  
- Constraint Tolerance: $$\(10^{-3}\)$$

The **genetic algorithm** (`ga()`) used to find the optimal configuration is as seen below:

$$[Xopt, cost] = ga(obj, 4, [], [], [], [], Xl, Xu, nlconstraints, [1 2 3], options)$$

2.  **System Sizing:** Calculate the power generated by each component (PV, wind, and battery).
3.  **Control Design:** Design the control system priorotise charging/discharging the battery before exporting or importing from thr grid
4. **Genetic Algorithm:**
   - Optimize the number of PV panels, wind turbines, and battery cells.
   - Minimize the total system investment cost, including both capital and operational expenses.
   - Constraints include meeting energy load requirements, staying within battery SOC limits, and respecting available land area for installation.
5. **Results:** The model outputs the best configuration of the system, along with financial metrics like payback period and internal rate of return (IRR).
