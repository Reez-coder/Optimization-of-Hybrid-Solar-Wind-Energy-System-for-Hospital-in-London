This repository contains a MATLAB-based optimization project focused on designing a hybrid energy system for a hospital. The system integrates solar photovoltaics (PV), wind turbines, and battery storage, aimed at reducing energy costs and minimizing dependency on the grid while ensuring reliable energy supply for critical medical operations.

## Introduction

Hospitals are among the most energy-intensive facilities, requiring continuous and reliable power sources to support medical operations. This project develops an energy optimization model to design a hybrid solar-wind energy system for a hospital located in London, UK. By incorporating solar PV, wind turbines, and battery storage, the goal is to provide a self-sufficient energy system that minimizes grid dependency, reduces operational costs, and supports sustainability goals.

The hybrid system is optimized to meet the hospital's energy demands while maximizing the utilization of renewable energy resources, considering the hospital's daily load profile, environmental conditions, and space constraints.

## Project Description

# üå± Hybrid Renewable Energy System Optimization
This system is optimized using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to determine the optimal configuration that minimizes the total system investment cost over a 10-year lifetime, while fulfilling the following constraints:

- **SOC Constraints:** The state of charge (SOC) of the battery must remain within 50% to 90%.
- **Power Supply Constraints:** The system must meet the energy load requirements, with any excess energy being exported.
- **Space Constraints:** The total space required for the PV panels and wind turbines must not exceed the usable area of the hospital‚Äôs rooftop or nearby land.

The optimization procedure also integrates a financial analysis to evaluate the feasibility and payback period of the system based on energy savings and export revenues via the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG) scheme.

 The project includes:
- Real-world data integration (irradiance, temperature, wind, and load)
- Physical modeling of solar, wind, and battery systems
- Cost and economic analysis (CAPEX + OPEX)
- Constrained multi-variable optimization
- Visual analytics of system behavior and energy flows

## Optimization Methodology


**Time Resolution:**
- \(\Delta T = 0.5\) hours (12 days √ó 24 hours = 288 hours total)

**Scaled Load Profile:**

\[
P_{\text{load}}(t) = P_{\text{load,raw}}(t) \cdot (1 + g)^{y}, \quad g = 0.025,\quad y = 10
\]

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Equations

### PV Output

\[
P_{\text{PV}}(t) = N_{\text{pv}} \cdot \eta_{\text{PV}} \cdot \frac{P_{\text{STC}}}{G_{\text{STC}}} \cdot \left(1 + C_T(T(t) - T_{\text{STC}})\right) \cdot G(t) \cdot (1 - r_{\text{deg}})^{y-1}
\]

Where:
- \( P_{\text{STC}} = 485 \, \text{W} \)
- \( \eta_{\text{PV}} = 0.99 \)
- \( G_{\text{STC}} = 1000 \, \text{W/m}^2 \)
- \( T_{\text{STC}} = 25^\circ C \)
- \( C_T = -0.0029 \, ^\circ C^{-1} \)
- \( r_{\text{deg}} = 0.004448 \)

### Wind Turbine Output

Based on a quadratic model fitted between cut-in speed \(v_{ci} = 2.5\) and rated speed \(v_r = 10\):

\[
P_{\text{wind}}(t) = N_{\text{turb}} \cdot (A + B \cdot v(t) + C \cdot v(t)^2) \cdot P_{\text{turb}}
\]

Where \( A, B, C \) are constants computed from wind curve parameters.

---

### Battery State of Charge (SOC)

\[
SOC(t+1) = SOC(t) + \frac{\eta_{\text{bat}} \cdot P_{\text{bat}}(t) \cdot \Delta T}{N_{\text{cell}} \cdot C_{\text{cell}}}
\]

Battery is charged or discharged based on surplus or deficit:

- If surplus:
  \[
  P_{\text{bat}}(t) = -\eta_{\text{DCDC}} \cdot \left(P_{\text{total}} - \frac{P_{\text{load}}(t)}{\eta_{\text{ACDC}}} \right)
  \]
- If deficit:
  \[
  P_{\text{bat}}(t) = -\frac{1}{\eta_{\text{DCDC}}} \cdot \left(P_{\text{total}} - \frac{P_{\text{load}}(t)}{\eta_{\text{ACDC}}} \right)
  \]

Where:
- \( P_{\text{total}} = \eta_{\text{DCDC}} \cdot P_{\text{PV}}(t) + \eta_{\text{ACDCw}} \cdot P_{\text{wind}}(t) \)

---

## üéØ Objective Function

Minimize total cost over 10 years:

\[
\min_{X} \quad C(X) = N_{\text{pv}} (C_{\text{inv,panel}} + OPEX_{\text{PV}}) + N_{\text{cell}} (C_{\text{inv,cell}} + OPEX_{\text{Battery}}) + N_{\text{turb}} (C_{\text{inv,turb}} + OPEX_{\text{Wind}})
\]

Where:

- \( OPEX_{\text{PV}} = 5.64 \cdot \frac{P_{\text{STC}}}{1000} \cdot 10 \)
- \( OPEX_{\text{Battery}} = 15.64 \cdot \frac{C_{\text{cell}}}{1000} \cdot 10 \)
- \( OPEX_{\text{Wind}} = 32.2 \cdot \frac{P_{\text{turb}}}{1000} \cdot 10 \)

---

## üìå Constraints

### Inequality Constraints

\[
\begin{aligned}
& SOC_{\text{min}} \leq SOC(t) \leq SOC_{\text{max}} \\
& \max(P_{\text{unsup}}(t)) = 0 \\
& SOC(0) = SOC(T_{\text{end}}) \\
& N_{\text{pv}} \cdot A_{\text{pv}} + N_{\text{turb}} \cdot A_{\text{turb}} \leq A_{\text{usable}}
\end{aligned}
\]

### Variable Bounds

\[
\begin{aligned}
1 &\leq N_{\text{pv}} \leq \left\lfloor \frac{A_{\text{usable}}}{A_{\text{pv}}} \right\rfloor \\
10 &\leq N_{\text{cell}} \leq 1000 \\
0 &\leq N_{\text{turb}} \leq \left\lfloor \frac{A_{\text{usable}}}{A_{\text{turb}}} \right\rfloor \\
SOC_{\text{min}} &\leq SOC_{\text{init}} \leq SOC_{\text{max}}
\end{aligned}
\]

## üß¨ Optimization Method

We use MATLAB‚Äôs **Genetic Algorithm** (`ga`) to solve:

\[
\min_{X \in \mathbb{R}^4} \quad C(X) \quad \text{subject to } c(X) \leq 0
\]

**GA Settings:**

- Population Size: 500  
- Max Generations: 10,000  
- Function Tolerance: \(10^{-12}\)  
- Constraint Tolerance: \(10^{-3}\)

The optimization model is implemented in MATLAB and follows these steps:
1. **Input Data:** Load the hospital's energy load profile, solar irradiance, wind speed, and temperature data.
2. **System Sizing:** Calculate the power generated by each component (PV, wind, and battery).
3. **Genetic Algorithm:**
   - Optimize the number of PV panels, wind turbines, and battery cells.
   - Minimize the total system investment cost, including both capital and operational expenses.
   - Constraints include meeting energy load requirements, staying within battery SOC limits, and respecting available land area for installation.
4. **Results:** The model outputs the best configuration of the system, along with financial metrics like payback period and internal rate of return (IRR).
